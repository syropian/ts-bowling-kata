## Notes

- Strike = knocking all 10 on first throw of frame. You do not get another throw for that frame unless you're in the last frame
- Spare = points total of both throws = 10

- Throwing a strike in the last frame allows for an additional 2 throws
- Throwing a spare in the last frame allows for an additional 1 throw
